## Welcome to the GameDev.tv Game Jam 2022 Project!
Hosted on [itch.io](https://somedumbfox.itch.io/gizmos-gambit)

Game is controlled only by mouse.

Shoot enemies to increase your score multiplier and gun upgrades.

Max multiplier is x9, max lives is 9.

You max multiplier is tied to how many lives you have.

| Num Lives | Max Multiplier |
| 9 | x9 |
| 6-8 | x6 |
| 4-6 | x4 |
| 2-3 | x2 |
| 1 | No bonus |

Every life lost will result in a pilot ghost that acts as a shield. Enemies can still hit you if they shoot throught the gaps.

Once all lives are lost, your ship will turn blue. Absorb enemy bullets to gain lives back. You have 9 seconds, depending on how well you do you will recover between 1-9 lives! (currently 1 bullet = one life)

Recovering lives will allow you to build out your max multiplier again. So use that to your advantage to build up as high as a score as possible in the run. Will you exploit your own death?

This game is [open sourced](https://github.com/somedumbfox/GameJam-2022), with a functioning CI/CD pipeline to automatcally build and deploy to itch.io. Feel free to watch this game evolve over time!
